# Invitation Generation 

This repo contains a set of Python/bash scripts that can be used to automatically generate Latex documents where only a few parameters like names, language (i.e., input file) used or certain flags change.  





## Improvements

Potentially, instead of the Python script also [GNU parallel](gnu.org/software/parallel/man.html) can be used. The rest of the files should still be quite useful, I hope.
